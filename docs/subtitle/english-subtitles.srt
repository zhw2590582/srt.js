00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
At the left we can see...

3
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:20,083
At the right we can see the...

4
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,000
...the head-snarlers

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,417
Everything is safe. Perfectly safe.

6
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,083
Emo?

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,042
Watch out!

8
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:48,542
Are you hurt?

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I don't think so. You?

10
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,042
I'm Ok.

11
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:01,167
Get up. Emo, it's not safe here.

12
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:03,167
Let's go.

13
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,167
What's next?

14
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:09,208
You'll see!

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
(howling wind)

16
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,083
Emo. This way.

17
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,542
Follow me!

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
(buzzing wires and chattery conversations)

19
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,542
Hurry Emo!

20
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:22,792
(louder telephone voices)

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,500
(phone ringing)

22
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,000
You're not paying attention!

23
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:54,125
I just want to answer the... ...phone.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,042
Emo, look, I mean listen.

25
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:02,083
You have to learn to listen.

26
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,042
This is not some game.

27
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:09,417
You, i mean we, we could easily die out here.

28
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:14,042
Listen, listen to the sounds of the machine.

29
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,083
Listen to your breathing.

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
(Buzzing wires)

31
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
(laughing)

32
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:15,417
(oriental dance music)

33
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:29,042
Well, don't you ever get tired of this?

34
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,000
Tired?!?

35
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:34,583
Emo, the machine is like clockwork.

36
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,167
One move out of place...

37
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,208
...and you're ground to a pulp.

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,083
But isn't it -

39
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:46,125
Pulp, Emo! Is that what you want, pulp?

40
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,083
Emo, your goal in life...

41
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,042
...pulp?

42
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,500
(loud metal sounds)

43
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,125
Emo, close your eyes.

44
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,125
Why? - Now!

45
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,208
Ok.

46
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,792
Good.

47
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,208
What do you see at your left side, Emo?

48
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,000
Nothing. - Really?

49
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,208
No, nothing at all.

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,083
And at your right, what do you see at your right side, Emo?

51
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,208
The same Proog, exactly the same...

52
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,208
...nothing! - Great.

53
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,208
(sound of camera flash)

54
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,792
(engine drone)

55
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,833
Listen Proog! Do you hear that! (amusement park music)

56
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:45,000
Can we go here?

57
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:48,000
There? It isn't safe, Emo.

58
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,125
But... - Trust me, it's not.

59
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,208
Maybe I could...

60
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,083
No.

61
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,042
NO!

62
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,167
Any further questions, Emo?

63
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,208
No.

64
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,208
Emo?

65
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,125
Emo, why...

66
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,125
Emo...

67
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:18,125
...why can't you see the beauty of this place?

68
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,167
The way it works.

69
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:24,000
How perfect it is.

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,083
No, Proog, I don't see.

71
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,083
I don't see because there's nothing there.

72
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:35,083
And why should I trust my life to something that isn't there?

73
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,042
Well can you tell me that?

74
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,042
Answer me!

75
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:44,125
Proog...

76
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,083
...you're a sick man!

77
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,042
Stay away from me!

78
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,000
No! Emo! It's a trap!

79
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,042
Hah, it's a trap.

80
00:07:57,042 --> 00:08:01,167
At the left side you can see the hanging gardens of Babylon!

81
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:04,083
How's that for a trap?

82
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,042
No, Emo.

83
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,208
At the right side you can see... ...well guess what...

84
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,792
...the colossus of Rhodes!

85
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,167
No!

86
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:22,042
The colossus of Rhodes and it is here just for you Proog.

87
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,042
It is there...

88
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:56,167
I'm telling you, Emo...

89
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,000
...it is.

90
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,500
(howling wind)
